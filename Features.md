# Features
## 1. Read a txt file representing multiple graphs

Each individual graph will be represented as an object that contains attributes representing metadata (name, date, description, etc) and each individual graph object will have a pd dataframe representing the graph as an adjacency matrix and a dictionary whose values are sets of tuples representing the adjacency lists
### b. Each object will then be appended into a python list (or maybe a numpy array) which will represent a collection of graphs
